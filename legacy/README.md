This directory includes some legacy code (kept for reference only):
  * All `bf-*` scripts were written for `Blackfynn`
    (which was renamed to `Pennsieve` in May 2021);
  * `old-psv-upload.bash`: old script to upload data
    (for `pennsieve-agent` version `0.3.5`)
  * `install.sh`: old installation script that confused (instead of helped)
