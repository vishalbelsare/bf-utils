This directory includes some legacy code (kept for reference only):
  * All `bf-*` scripts were written for `Blackfynn`
    (which was renamed to `Pennsieve` in May 2021);
  * `old-psv-upload.bash`: old script to upload data
    (for `pennsieve-agent` version `0.3.5`)
  * `install.sh`: old installation script that confused (instead of helped)
    users
  * `upload_imc.py`: based on the Jupyter Notebook at
    [here](https://github.com/faryabiLab/hpap-projects/blob/master/2019%20Projects/2019-06-12_IMC-upload/2019-06-12_IMC-upload-notebook.ipynb)
